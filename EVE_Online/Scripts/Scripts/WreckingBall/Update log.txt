**Update 1-10-2011
   Fixed some Noob errors. I think that the bot is actually going to do the whole field in one go (given you are in tractor range of all the wrecks)
   Added Tractor beam turn off method. It looks good so far, but full testing is yet to come
   Added cargo loot to main loop, also it works great now (noob error)
**Update 1-11-2011
  Removed the Tractor beam turn off method (with comments) until I get it right
  Works like a charm now! Give it a try!
**Update 1-11-2011
  I think I have the tractor beam turn off method working. The damn thing kept turning off other tractor beams for no reason, look at the if statement I am using in the tractor beam turn off method (~line 211), there is no reason I should have had to double wrap it (insert angry emoticon). But after a couple tests it looks good and works good, lets hope it stays that way.
  I updated my goals for the bot in light of figuring out half of my junk ### problem
  Junk now breaks at 25 for speed purposes, I bet it could go down to less considering ${Me.MaxLockedTargets}
  Less console spam!! Now only the more important messages get through.
  I am looking into the GUI on/off switch sometime tonight as well, but it looks daunting
  **Update 1-13-2011
  Cleaned up shop a little more, deleted most unwanted debug echoes, polished up and added comments
  Wrapped the tractor turn off in a third if, with some extra wait time included (I hate using wait), but now it seems almost 100% accurate at turning off the right tractor beam
  I added a new method for counting wrecks, the old way I just parsed all entities with "wreck" in their name, now it takes that list and whacks out the wrecks that we don't have loot rights too. The loot rights check was always there, but it was part of the targeting if statement, now it will weed them out before the bot has a chance to really see them (this is a useful way to ensure that only ship wrecks are part of the bots targets rather than finding some random entity named wreck)
  I improved some of the conditionals, but I can't remember where since I did it last night. If a bug pops up this is probably the case, but my couple of tests were successful.
  Oh and this is cool. When there is less than 4 wrecks the bot will now utilize any and all available salvagers. (Not fully optimized(may not be needed), and not fully tested, but like most of my updates it looks great on my end)
  Also shrunk the the tractoring requirements from 2300m to 1800m in lieu of Serpent's post, I hope/don't think this was the issue, but in all fairness 1800 is probably a better bet for stability just in case your ship is drifting a pinch
  Also added EVE:Execute[CmdStopShip] so you can be assured there will be no drift. ( No moving is what this bot is intended for as a max lvl ore industrialist can get those tractors out over 80k I think, I am at 56k with lvl 3)
  Noticed a couple things that require my attention as far as turning on tractors (still happening to fast for slower pcs) I might have to slow it down, but I am going to try some other things first.
**Update 01-14-11
  BIG BIG BIG CHANGES
  Dynamic wait system, should speed it up on faster pcs, and make it more stable on slower ones.
  Looting is now done while waiting for target aquisition (loops too!!! Its cool!)
  By popular request (hehe) it will now tractor in cargo containers that are too far away. (I know I know, overdue, but hey (insert lame excuse))
  What else....
  Most conditionals are now double wrapped for your protection (stability improved significantly)
  I think overall I am down to one last major bug (Tractor beam turn off method). So if the bot doesn't tractor 1 maybe 2 wrecks this is why, believe me most of my time is devoted to this bug. I beg anyone for help. (See below conversations)
  Cut down a lot of useless babble in my main post (I might just be talking to myself, but its cool to see the history of growth occurring)
  A thought occured to me about my tractor turn off problem, a bit of testing and I bet I can nail that sucker to the wall, this problem seems to occur when wrecks leave the grid **Scratches his chin**
  **Update later that day
  I am putting up a test copy called wballtest, I haven't tested it yet cause I am going to bed, but if I have any loyals out there :zorro: they can try this. It is my first in a series of different approaches to the tractor beam turn off issues I keep running into. The theory is sound, but then so were many others. I am sorry if it contains any fatal errors, but its worth a shot if this stupid bot keeps prematurely turning off tractors.
  Remember to check back often. I intend to make this a great and super fast salvager.
  Wow I talk a lot, removed a bunch of old updates (Sorry if I spam the forum guys)
**Update after waking up
  Wballtest did contain a nasty error, sorry guys, was as stupid as "True" needed to be "TRUE". That is fixed and the new one is up, initial testing looks good, more to come later tonight! Check back often!!
 After a few tests the wballtest still has the bug, grrrr. A new idea is cropping up though.
 ** A new wballtest is out as of 1/15/2011
 This will be my platform from now on to test new bug fixes
 Untested as of initial release, but so far no fatal errors
 More comments, changed echoes, tidied up again
[COLOR="DarkOrange"]A new echo will sound ${Counter} this is an important one[/COLOR] 
 [COLOR="Blue"]When testing and reviewing wballtest please try to include the values along with things like Active target wait-## , SalvagerID wait-## , Anything that says wait and has a 2 digit number[/COLOR]
 If these 2 digit numbers are consistently numbers like 10, 15, or 30, and you have a lot of issues (tractors not tractoring, loot not looting) it means the script isn't waiting long enough for your slow computer. Try manually extending the ${Counter} checks by increments of 5-10 in problem areas (I don't have a supercomputer or anything, but I am seeing waits of 1-4, when lag spikes it gets up to 10)
 After thorough testing and approval of the new tractor turn off method I implemented hopefully I can revise the original Wreckingball, but this is tentative.
 Big early thanks to any testers I have gritting their teeth through my noobish bugs and errors, trusting I will come out with a great product soon. (I want it badly too so like I always say come back often. When I work on it it gets updated every few hours)
 ** A couple of runs on the wballtest were bad, but I think I found where I made a stupid mistake, again untested *fully* but mistake fixed with luck I should get this tractoring thing under control, gonna go test it now, I'll let you know.
 ** Before reset
  Initial testing on my end is looking great on the wballtest. So far I haven't had anymore bad ids passed into my tractor turn offs, but further testing after reset.
 I posted the latest tested wballtest, thorough testing to come
 I moved the tractor turn off to after the salvager turn on, it seemed like a logical place (do more work, while you are waiting on tractor turn offs)
 Oh and I picked up a cargo rig in the bot, so it seems I will need more thorough wreck checks, until then just blow them up, who knows you might get another container for the bot. (Actually without testing I will bet the solution is a HaveLootRights check, haha silly of me to not check that on containers horrible horrible, also put this in WreckingBall.iss)
 Remember the wait counters are in there so if they are getting to numbers like 10, 15, 30 then the script is not waiting long enough, let me know if this is the case, or you can change the counter timeouts manually (I would hate to have to use an argument for my script, but it might resolve a lot of issues for those using a slower pc, turn down the speed a notch with an argument, or pass full speed default hmmm....)
** After reset
 No luck fighting my issues with Module.Get.TargetID
 Still turns off the wrong tractors every once in a while
 Anyone taking apart wballtest can ignore the PreviousTargetsCount and NewTargetsCount, it was an idea that didn't pan out, won't interfere with operations, but I am not gonna take it out yet, just fyi its garbage
 I exhausted my ideas for tonight, started begging for help in the general help forum, and with my head pounding I turn in for the night.
 I will be back with a vengeance come morning though, hopefully I get some tips on my issue
** 1/15/2011
 Sorry guys looks like I broke wreckingball last night and didn't even see it. Big apologies, been a rough week.
 Uploaded fixed wreckingball, also moved the tractor turn off below salvager turn on like I did in wballtest last night
 Wreckingball is so far the best one, but I am still trying some new wballtests, a new one should be up shortly after I make sure this time there are no fatal errors, sorry guys
 ** 1/16
 Ohhhh the honorary sticky!?!? Thank you, you honor me by thinking its that good! I better start delivering
 So for now Wreckingball has had the tractor turn off removed (by comments so its still in there just non functional)
 I am proud to say that my MANY tests (many tests this time hehe) have been 100% successful on Wreckingball. Use at will
 Since it no longer tries to turn off the beams there are 100% no errors (as far as I can tell)
 If you find a bug let me know ASAP (I think I might turn on mIRC for tonight and sit with the bunches in the isxeve irc try and find me there)
 Its still pretty fast, just not as much as I want it when I train multitasking, but this will be a while so I have time to figure it out (sorry to those with it, but its still high on my goals)
 Strategic cruiser training finished on the main so wrecks are much more plentiful for me and easier to generate, which means more thorough testing before an update
 I will also look and see if I can get the bot to tell the difference from a salvager and an analyzer/codebreaker (Until then those are a no-no)
 Sorry no Wballtest for the night, no good ideas yet. Will post as soon as I have a good one
** Wrecking ball no longer picks up analyzers and codebreakers, equip them without worry
**1/18
 I hate resets, especially big ones, but its good news for the community cause I was hard at work. As soon as I can confirm it working I will put up a new wballtest that should be full of fun new things.
**Later that day
 Good, I can't test it. I wasn't ready hahahahaha, and its bed time zzzzzzzzzzzzz.
 Lets show some patience and understanding to Amadeus today. He is SURELY being inundated with requests to update. LEAVE HIM BE FFS!!! He will get us back to not playing our games soon!
 I still have major work to do. I have only just begun on all the new things.
 After I can test each new addition thoroughly expect a wballtest to appear with MANY MANY MANY more features
 Things like-
 Approaching wrecks to far to tractor (Reason the tractor turn off was abandoned for now, I am thinkng of going to 5 tractors 3 salvagers myself)
 Going to multiple salvage bookmarks
 Improved wait system to help slower/laggier pcs by turning on slow mode (not really that much slower, but gives extra time for modules to be confirmed active and things like that)
 A debug option (defaulted off) so you don't have to listen to the bot talk so much
 When operations are done you can choose to-
 Approach an acceleration gate,
 Warp to a safe spot,
 Go home,
 Or none of the above.
 -noloot (need I say more?)
 And of course the psychiatrist will tell you all of the commands should you ask for help
 So far my arguments I have planned are:
 -noloot
 -safe (will be used for home as well I think)
 -gate
 -more
 -slow
 -debug
 -help

Whether they all come out ok is down the road, but I have sound plans for all.
One of my real concerns are drugs winding up in the inventory when using -safe to go home and cross a jump gate. (I'll look into loot filtering later though)
Any other ideas anyone? Put them here

** During reset 1/19
Testing is coming along nicely, getting some initial bugs worked out.
So far everything has been implemented into the wballtest with the exception of the -gate argument (more research will be needed)
I will be doing more thorough testing after reset and expect to have wballtest up within a couple hours
** Almost there on the new wballtest
All the new features have come out great
-more will take the bot to multiple bookmarks in multiple systems
-safe uses safe spots and docks at stations after operations
-noloot is untested as of yet (but its so simple it shouldn't have any problems)
-gate was not implemented yet, the argument exists, but it will give you a sarcastic echo at the end
-debug will let you listen to what the bot is doing, default is off and you will get WAAAAAY less chatter (its lonely though)
-slow for that additional performance (doesn't sacrifice a lot of speed either!!!)
Let me run the bot through some fields now and work out if I screwed up the engine or not
Also going to run the new approach system through the works
Should be just fine and ready to go, but I want to make sure before it goes public
****   1-19  *****
See all the goodness above!!!!
The Wballtest is out
And I am going to bed while you test it for bugs (sorry if there is a fatal one hiding in there I didn't catch, as you can see she doubled in size)
1-20
fixed small bug in wballtest causing it to approach all wrecks, its only supposed to approach out of range ones
Wballtest is looking great, I encourage all to try it, if you liked what wreckingball does
1-21
Everytime I ran the new Wballtest today it gave me great results, I can now look away from it and continue to finish the mission and trust it to finish the job and even go home when done if I want it.
So far I have not witnessed any of the new ERR's I put in pop up, let me know if you experience them in a particular area often
When I get more motivation I am going to finish of some goals, and split this script into different utilities.
I plan on having a nice and fully featured bot loaded with arguments or maybe a gui if I ever feel like.
For others I will make a standalone function with its own unique variables (also optional looting) for use in your own scripts, just include it, call it and off you go, just the salvaging engine designed for a noctis.
Feel free to pm any reviews! Whats good, whats bad, what would/did you change?
**1-23 around reset
 Wballtest works great, but I am going to tune up a couple things tonight that I have noticed in testing.
 After a large engagement with the federation navy (they always drop at least a tag) I noticed how poorly the bot was handling large scale looting when moving. I am going to add the container locking to the general targeting method in an attempt to improve this. (Still going to abide by -noloot, don't worry)
 Also a container had snuck out of range of the looting method or something and I got a bunch of those err's I was talking about, I had to endscript to fix it. This will be investigated.
 I am also going to start work on my goals, some will get finished, some won't, some new ones might pop up as well, we'll see how well I do.
 Now is the time to request anymore features, or any issues you saw, don't be shy, a short and sweet pm is fine, reply to my posts, whatever. This project is going to be put on back burner soon.
 I will still make sure she is bug free, but this was a learning project for me, my time will soon be vested in my other project goals. So hurry up if you want to see something on the goals page!
 1-25
Sorry for the recent delays in my updating, getting new carpet installed.
I put up a new wballtest today.
Approaching has been tuned up.
I now have the bot lock cargo containers during the general locking routine, it works great once more of the wrecks are gone so looks like containers will be last again, but it doesn't seem to affect performance too greatly, just has some additional cleanup to do after the wrecks are gone (this is the price we have to pay for the bot to approach for itself)
MUCH stricter requirements on looting distance. Now down to 1500m or less with a terminate looting if the wreck gets more than 2200m away. This resolved the ERR's I was having with looting (as I am sure many others have seen)
InStation detection only. You can now start the bot in a station using the -more command and relevant bookmarks. Just run the script like you normally did, only now you can start in a station.
I wrote the method for jettisoning contraband, but the Item.IsContraband member no longer exists so until I find a working way to detect contraband this is still a non functioning part of the script. If anyone knows how to tell if an item is contraband let me know and I can have it in the script in minutes. All thats missing is the If Item is Contraband check, everything else to handle the contraband is written.
Also the bot will NO LONGER try to salvage cargo containers! hehehe
I was happy with the couple of tests done, but it wasn't quite as thorough as I would like, but my time recently has been limited. If you find something wrong let me know ASAP so I don't have a broken script on the forums!
It may also be wise to backup the current version of your wballtest, in case this on produces undesirable results, and I am unable to get a fix up quick enough, it shouldn't happen, but I have been wrong before.
Also will delete bookmarks after it is done salvaging at them
I think it was my last update, but I didn't mention it, the bot now tractors EVERYTHING without concern for distance, due to the approaching it was necessary
**Later that day**
Removed distance requirement for locking cargo containers, silly me
Revamping has begun, but we'll see when the wballfull hits the shelves
1-31
Some behavioral modifications
Looting requirements were lightened up
The bot will now avoid locking containers within 1500m
A couple other requirements were lightened up, can't remember where at the moment.
Some waiting has been removed (More speed)
Fixed a bug preventing the bot from approaching wrecks that became out of range at a later time.
If I remember any other changes I will update this post.
Removing Wreckingball for now until it becomes its own function, don't worry if you preferred the original, just run wballtest without the arguments and it is still just wreckingball.

2-3
Fixed that nasty bug tht prevented the bot from locking out of range cargo containers. Enjoy!!
The new one is coming together well now -
Gui looks great and lots of check boxes for all you demanding more options
All my objects are laid out, I need to make sure they work and tune them up as needed
I have begun writing the behavior for the salvager as well.
Also many other behaviors to come! I will keep this a surprise though hehehe.

2-6
Its here at long last.

2-7
I will be posting a new one very soon, gotta try it out
Found a bug with deciding what max targets to use
Testing the new wreck velocity check, worked great, just testing the fine tuning. This means there will NEVER be a wreck left behind EVER again. THANK GOD!! A bot that will actually go all the way!!
Also testing a new activate module function, this should also mean that no salvager will be skipped either (hopefully hehe), either way with the new tractor checks, it will get salvaged in the end when the wrecks count is < 5
Also testing some new looting checks.
Added a global wait to the bot after target acquisition and before beginning to tractor, there always seems to be a pinch of lag right at the end of targeting, this compensates for that, and also slows the bot down when it is bored. Don't worry I made it as small as possible, you shouldn't even notice it there.

-Prior to reset 2-7
Yep updated.
Tractors now check wreck velocity. This means two things, a wreck will never go untractored again EVER, and I sacrificed a bit of speed activating the tractors, just a bit, it takes the client a second or so to register the wrecks velocity. More stability less speed, not much less, but noticeable.
Tractors will not activate on wrecks that are closer than 2000, this is necessary with the new velocity check. If they move farther than 2000 they will get tractored.
Changed the looting. I think now it will loot everything in range before moving on to tractors, let me know what you think.
Still fighting with the salvagers, once in a while they will skip a wreck. Don't worry I am working on it, but it shouldn't prevent the bot from completing its job. I wish there was something like the tractor's velocity check I could do like if Entity.IsBeingDatamined

2-8

Fixed some bugs, bot would hang when it couldn't activate modules
Also fixed a crash that happened with approaching stuff.
I also noticed if you quit the bot in the middle of salvaging, the wrecks seem to have velocity even when not being tractored. I warped away and warped back and it fixed, but I will put a fix in and post it up soon.

2-14

Going to be posting an update soon hopefully that will include things like....
"Group - Drugs" ID="313" Will be jettisoned before leaving the salvage zone.
Implemented a GoTo Bookmark feature. Name your destination with an ! and off you go, will dock if its a station, undocks if started in one.
Goofed around with the GUI layout, exit is gone, X now closes it down.
Readable messages in the console rather than a blur of speed.
