Revision History
----------------
v2.40 -   * Re-coded the follow script to use objects.
	* First stage of converting eq2bot to use objects.

v2.31 -   * Fixed some issues when grouping with 1 or more players and follow (i.e bots will no longer try to follow once in combat).
	* Only the Main Assist will move if there is aggro nearby with AutoHunt.

v2.30 -   * Fixed an issue with refreshtimer for CastSpellRange
	* If you go out of range with AutoHunt, it will move closer (randomly) to the home point instead of going directly there.
	* More fixes and tweaks with eq2bot and follow.
	* Improved Defiler, Wizard, Bruiser and Conjuror class scripts as well as fixing some bugs.
	* Pressing F11 will now stop eq2bot no matter what it was currently doing.

v2.25 -   * Added more functionality to AutoHunt. If your fighting or just resting, it will check to see if you get adds, and move away appropriately.
	* Several fixes to the last update.

v2.20 -   * You can now select a Main Tank within a raid for assist.
	* Increased Preaction array to 20. Make sure you change xAction:Set[20] in the class routines for Buff_Routine function.
	* Removed CheckHeals from eq2bot and moved it into the specific class routines. If you need any function called before or 
                after any action like CheckHeals (pre-combat, combat or post-combat) then see Templar.iss for an example.
	* Modified the CastSpellRange Function as follows;
	  The Syntax is - call CastSpellRange <start> <finish> <rangetype> <position> <targettobuff> <notall> <refresh timer>
	  Where <start> and <finish> is the spell range you want to cast.
	  <rangetype> (1=close, 2=max range, 3=bow shooting)
	  <position> (0=anywhere, 1=behind, 2=front, 3=flank)
	  <targettobuff> is the ID of the Actor you want to buff or target for the spell
	  <notall> 1=If it casts a spell in the range, then ignore the remaining spells in the range (example, casting 2 different rezzes, it will only cast the first one thats ready)
	  <refresh timer> Specify a time to refresh that spell (see below for a good example).
	  After you call CastSpellRange, you can use ${Return} to check the TimeUntilReady for spells like mezzes.

	  e.g Lets say you want to keep root on a mob. You will have to add a new function in your class routine (Like for Checkheals) in the Combat_Routine function.

	  function Combat_Routine(int xAction)
	  {
		call CheckRoot
	  	switch ${Action[${xAction}]}
		{
			<rest of code here>
		}
	  }

	  function CheckRoot()
	  {
		; This will keep root on a mob and recast when it has 5 seconds left on the existing root.
		call CastSpellRange 230 0 0 0 ${Target.ID} 0 5

		; Add code to check your not close to mob, and backup for a few seconds if need be.
	  }

v2.10 -   * Fixed AutoHunt. Should be a lot improved with the way it works now.
	* Fixed Looting for no-trade.

	* Loot will work with Lotto.

v1.60 -	* Implemented Dungeon Crawl. Ensure you create a nav path with 2 points called Start and Finish
	  /run eq2bot -d (this will run the path with the puller/main assist)
	  Ensure other bots are using follow mode.

v1.50 -	* File Paths have been completely restructured.
	* Lots of tweaks and fixes.
	* Added AttackNamed variable if you want to attack named mobs (TRUE by default).
	* AutoHunt fixed.
	* Puller will now scan each waypoint for mobs to pull, before he goes out and pulls (scan upto 150 range)
	* If the main assist dies, then it will automatically pick an appropriate 2nd assist based on class and HP.

v1.30 -	* More class routines for the lower levels have been added.
	* More tweaks and tunning to class routines and the main eq2bot.
	* Added a Auto Hunting option. e.g
		run eq2bot -a
	  This is currently and experimental feature which lets the bot automatically pick targets, run to them and kill them.
	  If you want to use this method for soloing, then you can add special case routines to check for ${AutoHunt}.
