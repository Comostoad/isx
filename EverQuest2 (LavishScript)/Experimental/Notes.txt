This folder contains 'work-in-progress', experimental changes to eq2bot and several class files.  There is absolutely no guarantee that any files in this tree will actually work.   Understand that 100% of my development is done in an environment that I don't have the luxury of loading the game to test with.  As such my experimental releases are often bug laiden, and full of syntax errors. 

This tree is meant to serve as a central repository of my working files as I move between locations, and serves as a refference point to anyone assisting on the eq2bot project.

You've been warned.
