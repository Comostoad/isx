REVISION HISTORY

BJXPBot-2012.04.08, Version 3.04

STATISTICS TAB
	- Removed the looted coin information.  It was redundant with the information on the looter tab.

POTIONS TAB
	- Added the ability to save/load the "Potion Priority List".  This will allow the user to save and share potion lists with other toons.
		- Added a default potion priority list

SETTINGS PAGE
	- Added a new tab to the settings page (Looter Tab)
		- Integrated BJLooter script

GENERAL
	- Fixed a bug where if you ran out of potions in your potion list and then added more the script wouldn't start at the top of list to check for the new potions.
	- Added an extra command to make running the script easier.  The script can now be run by typing the following into the console: run bj xpbot
	
SETUP TAB
	- The following default values have been added:
		- Current Max Adv Level = 90
		- Current Max TS Level = 90
		- Current Max AA Level = Dynamic data read from the eq2 server (Currently 320)

MAIN SCRIPT
	- Removed references to the following outdated UI pieces:
		- timerunningvar
		- timerunningvar2

BJXPBot-2012.04.07, Version 3.03

- [BUG] Inventory check doesn't include SC bought potions if they are stacked, but does display them if they are separated out. [FIXED]
- [BUG] If you are out of xp potions or have disabled the consumption of xp potions it will not consume vitality items regardless of if that option is enabled. [FIXED]
- [BUG] If no selection is made for any combobox when the script saves it will save the combobox ID. [FIXED]

- SETTINGS PAGE UI
	- Fixed an issue with the frame buttons not being placed in the correct location
	- Added a Save button

		- Self Revival Combobox
		- Potion Priority List Listbox
	- Fixed a small 3 second pulse that occurred in the time until next attempt timer
	- Time until next attempt has been revamped.  The script will read the duration of the potion it just consumed and set the next attempt time accordingly.  If a potion was already active when the script was started it will continue attempts in 10 minute intervals until successful.
	- Time Left Until Next Attempt has had hours added to it
	
- POTIONS Tab
	- You can now re-enable potion consumption by clicking the enable potion consumption checkbox if you run out of potions or had disabled auto consumption without stopping and starting the script

		- Allow customizable priority list (Like Ogre CA's)
