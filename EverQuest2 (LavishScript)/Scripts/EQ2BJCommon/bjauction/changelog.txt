Many thanks to Kannkor for a TON of coding help.

INSTRUCTIONS



COMING SOON...

- Text entry for a timer
- Start/Stop timer button
- Text field to display a countdown timer
- Auto scanning of chat logs to create a DB for item links.
		- Scan chat logs and store any item links.  When you are examining an item it will check the name against the DB to pull the link up.
- Add bid incriment text field
- Split into semi-auto and manual
		- Semi-auto changes the value of the bids based on text response.
		- Manual doesn't change anything automatically.  Useful if you just want to save time retyping the same format for all your loot auctions.
- Add functionality to support two items simultaneously.
		- Examine item one and click set item one. The name of the item will be displayed on screen.  Examine item two and click set item two and the name of the item will be displayed on screen.
		- Clear items button.

		
KNOWN BUGS

- HighBid can return more than numbers, which looks bad. (IE. 90 priest --> returns as 90 priest instead of just 90)
		- Something wrong with the if statements on line 130
