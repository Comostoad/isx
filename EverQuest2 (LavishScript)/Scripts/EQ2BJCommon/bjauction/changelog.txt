REVISION HISTORY

BJAuctionBot-2012.12.02, Version 1.00

- Two timers 
	- First timer will start when you click the Start button and will count up until you press the Stop button.  This will show you how long it has been since the start of the auction.
	- Second timer will start when you click the Start button and will count up until you press the Update button, Stop button or Going/Sold buttons.  Every time you press the Update button, going once button, going twice button or Sold button it will reset this timer to zero.  This will show you how long it has been since you last updated/posted something to your channel.
- Preview Window
	- Hit the preview button to open another window where you can see an approximation of what will be posted to your chat window.
	- This is an approximation ONLY.  It will show you all options regardless of if you have the checkbox enabled or not.  For example, if you do not have the optional text checkbox enabled it will still show the optional text in the preview.  However, when you post it to your channel it the optional text will not be there.  Same with Item2.  The preview will always show Item2, but if you don't have a second item to auction your actual post will not include it.
- Settings Button
	- Settings Frame
		- Custom Going Phrases text boxes
