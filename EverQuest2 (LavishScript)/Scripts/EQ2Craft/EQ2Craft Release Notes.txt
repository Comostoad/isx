Revision History ||
===================
v8.44 - Craft Lite!
        - You can now use the Craft Lite button in the titlebar to switch between the Craft Full
          version and the Craft Lite version.
        - When Craft is in Lite mode, it will pick up and button mash for any recipe you start
          manually. Craft will start mashing buttons after the first "tick". This should work
          for ANY recipe, though I'm not sure I'd trust it with the level 100 artisan epic quest
          recipes.
        - Craft Lite will use the "Rare" thresholds from the Options page to determine when to 
          use power and durability buffs.

v8.33 - Fixed auto-transmute functionality (I think)
      - Trimmed out much unused code.
      - Tuned buff spamming - This should speed up the crafting process immensely.
      - Added tooltips to the Durability Threshold elements explaining what they are used for.
      - Tweaked imbue code. Blessed items should now be filtered by the imbue checkbox, and imbues
        of all levels should work correctly.

v8.32 - Forcing script to forget what device it was at after finishing a craft session. This should
        eliminate a few annoying issues where you move around after doing some crafting, and the
        script thinks you're still in front of a device (or targetting a particular NPC).
      - Fixed the GUI to allow mouse focus where mouse focus is desired, e.g. the harvest list
        scrollbar. This fix also includes miscellaneous other shuffling and resizing of UI elements.

v8.31 - New option on Options tab - Save recipe list range. Enabling this option will keep EQ2Craft
        from automatically assigning the most recent 10 levels to the Recipe List drop-down box.
        The current level range will be saved when setting this option, and every time you refresh
        the list.
        *NOTE* If you set this to a large range, it may take significantly longer for Craft to
               initialize.
      - Fixed the disappearing secondary tradeskill filter. If there are any secondary tradeskill
        recipes in the level range, the secondary tradeskill filter checkbox will become visible
        when the list is refreshed.

***** THIS IS FOR THE BETA TEST OF CRAFT 8.0 -- READ THE FORUMS *****
BETA 8.0 - Fixed a ton of stuff.  A lot of things that were broken are now fixed.  I don't remember
           them all to paste them here; however, I suggest you try everything again that you had
           problems with previously.
         - Added an uption under the "Special" tab called 'Stop crafting when secondary tradeskill achieves maximum level'.
           If checked, you will stop crafting when your tinkering or transmuting skill reaches the 
           maximum for your current skill level.   This value, intentionally, does not save to your configuration file.   
         - Most of the textentry boxes in the UI will now update the script and save to the xml file immediately.     
         - The "Custom Writs" xml file will now sort alphabetically automatically.  Simply add recipes to the bottom of 
           the file as you always did, and then the next time you end craft it will sort properly upon exit.
           
================================================

v7.10 - EQ2Craft should be less likely to be stuck "Processing Recipes".
      - When you gain a tradeskill level (after level 20) EQ2Craft will scribe any 'essentials'
        or 'advanced' recipe books that you have in your inventory for the level gained before
        acquiring the next writ.
      - Movement issues have been addressed somewhat.  In the near future we will be transitioning
        to LavishNav, so if there are bugs remaining, they will probably remain until that transition
        is complete.

v7.09 - Added option to GUI for fine-tuning the path precision on a per-character basis. This
        option can be found on the Options tab. If you are bouncing back and forth while running
        the path, you will want to increase this number. If you are not bouncing, but are not 
        getting close enough to your work tables, you will want to decrease this number.

v7.08 - Tweaks to pathing code -- should now open doors in qeynos properly again and not get
        stuck as often.
      - New path files for Qeynos and Freeport instances is on the SVN! Also updated Kelethin.
      
v7.07 - Minor change to inventory search -- allows for resources etc with space to underscore
        conversion; e.g. flying fish -> flying_fish_
        Note: This is an all-or-nothing conversion, either all spaces are underscores, or none.
        
v7.06 - Moved all writ quantities to a new file, WritCounts.xml.
      - Removed another section of code that could cause a writ to finish early.
      - Committed a Custom Writ file to the SVN. -- You may wish to back up your own 
        customwrits.xml file before updating! This file has a broader assortment of recipes.
      
v7.05 - Changed output to default ALL output to the console. You may use /craft -verbose
        for the old behavior of output in the EQ2 chat window.
      - Fixed imbue material counting.
      - Removed code that checks for a completed writ step. It was buggy and broken anyway.
        This should fix those writs that were completing early.
      - Fixed writ quantities for level 24 armorer.
        
v7.04 - Fixed lvl 50 Alchemist writ quantities.
      - Fixed reset issue after finishing the requested number of writs. Craft should now
        create the correct number of writs again after running through a writ cycle.
      - Crash when turning in a writ has been fixed by Amadeus (no credit for me on this.)
      
v7.03 - Valerian takes over as primary maintainer of craft.
      - Fixed double hailing of writ giver.
      - Bot should now automatically create exactly enough items to complete the writ,
        whether work order or rush order. Quantity textbox in the UI now does nothing.
        *TODO* Fix quantity textbox to "add" extra quantity, for those that want a
               safety net when doing writs.
      - Support files updates:
        * Added path for Kelethin's crafting area! You should be within the building before
          starting anything requiring pathing.
        * Fixed bug where any recipe containing the word "fir" was mistakenly marked as rare.
        
v7.02 - Craft should no longer double click the table when going through doors in Qeynos.
      - Fixed random typos.
      - Added more resources.

v7.01 - Fixed a typo when processing writs.
      - Took out debug spam.

v7.0  - IMPORTANT On the options tab, you MUST reset and save thresholds.
         *Craft files have been updated to work with T8 (some things may still be
         missing).
         * Buff selection - Craft will spam progress buffs every round until
         QualityTier4 is under 40% (Standard Quality 1 Threshold). Then it will
         use the Highest power durability with the 2 lowest power progress buffs.
             - If QuailtyTier4 is under 20% (Standard Quality 2 Threshold), it will use
             all durability buffs.
             - If power drops below 70% (Standard Power 3 Threshold), it will stop
             using the highest power progress buff unless it is needed for a counter.
         *Counter Selection - Craft will always counter with progress buff as a
         successful counter is always a successful round. You can NOT get a
         failure or critical failure with a success full counter. If quailtytier4
         is under 20% (Standard Quality 2 Threshold) it will counter with
         durability, as even a success can lower durability slightly.
         *Tinkering and Transmuting has been updated to work like other craft
         recipes.
         *Writs have been updated to work with T8.
         *Fixed a bug when loading recipes lists via command line.

v6.9  - There is now a custom writ file in Recipe Data folder called CustomWrits.xml
        You can now set a recipe name that is extracted and set the value to what it should be. See the file for some examples.
        So if there are any wierd names for writs, just use the customwrit file for the translation.

v6.8  - Fixes.

v6.7  - Fixes.

v6.6  - Writs should now work as intended for all classes without crashes.

v6.5  - Fixed all Imbue Recipes.
      - Minor fix to Writs with regards to the quest update trigger.

v6.4  - Few minor bug fixes

v6.3  - Fixed doors in Qeynos Tradeskills

v6.2  - You can now craft a Recipe from your 'Recipe Favourites' on the command line, which will avoid any prompting.
        Example: If you had previously saved a recipe called 'Cobalt full suit' under Advanced, then based on what settings you have currently set,
        you can just type in /craft "Cobalt full suit" and it will automatically craft whatever recipes you had listed under that favourite.
      - Added an optional delay between combines. This can be found under options.
      - You can now set a durability threshold for each quality level using standard or rare recipes. This can also be found under options
        Example: If you set the Durability threshold for Quality 1 to 105%, and Quality 2, to 95%, then the craft bot will only use Durability buffs,
        if the current Durability is less than 105% during the 1st Quality and less than 95% during the 2nd and so on.
        This should allow a lot more flexibility in the crafting process.
      - Added Automatic Crafting of Writs. See the Special Tab.
        You need to select a Tier. This reflects the response you select when obtaining the writ.
        You will need to specify the quantity however, as I did not have time to figure this out. Currently this is set to 10 for each recipe.
        It wont matter if you set a higher quantity as the craft bot will end when its made enough quantity for the recipe writ.
        You can also specify how many writs you want to do.
      - Fixed a few minor bugs that have been posted on the forums.

v6.1  - If a recipe fails to load, it will now open the examine window to retrieve the data from the server.
      - Added filters (Standard, Rare, Imbued and/or Secondary TS) to display in the Recipe List.
        Note: This will also reflect what recipes are loaded as well, when you Add Level Recipes.
      - Fixed several bugs that have been posted on the forums.

v6.0  - The recipe files are no more! The recipe data is now retrieved from the server.
        Note: If the data is not available on your client, it will re-sync and re-process the recipe again.
      - You can now craft Tinkering and Transmuting recipes.
      - Select 'Automatically Transmute Master Crafted Items after Creation' in the Special tab to do just that.
        Note: This is turned off by default everytime you start craft for obvious reasons.
      - Added a checkbox to show only the Secondary Tradeskill Recipes (Tinkering or Transmuting).
      - You can now choose to wait for your power to regenerate a certain amount after each recipe is made if you wish (see options).
      - Fixed the way counters work. After each round, the buffs will be cleared before it uses them again to avoid stacking issues.
      - Tuned buffs in general so its more efficient in crafting.
      - The craft session will remain opened if you dont choose to exit after a crafting session is complete.
      - Lots of general fixes that have been posted on the forums.

v5.3  - More fixes.
      - Added option to camp out after craft session while the bot is crafting.
      - Option to pause the bot when it cant buy all harvest components.

v5.2  - Minor fixes

v5.1  - PC Detection and smarter positioning (more random and not close to other PC's) for any device or NPC.
      - Bot will just move to a station directly if not in a tradeskill instance (so no need for a path file if your crafting at home).

v5.0  - Added buying of harvests, fuels and common components Automatically.
      - Added Automatic creation of Writs.
      - Fixed an issue with missing resouces and bot locking out components in the inventory.
      - Path restructure. All files are now located under ./Scripts/EQ2Craft/...
      - Optimized code to work even faster since subcombines have been removed.
      - Bot will detect if door is open or not, and no longer stop at door to open it, but instead open it while its moving towards it (qeynos).
 
v4.4  - Fixed issue with not being able to craft Rare combines.
      - Rares or any other unique component used for crafting can be included in the CraftCommon.xml file.
      - Example: <Setting Name="cobalt cluster">cobalt</Setting>
        The 'cobalt cluster' is used to determine whethere is a rare or unique component.
        The 'cobalt' is used for partial matching for loading all recipes in a particular level (so any recipe that has the word cobalt will be excluded).

v4.3  - Fixed craft to work with the current stable IS release.
      - Fixed the locking of components so it should no longer happen.

v4.2  - Several Fixes to v4.1

v4.1  - Craft should now be able to make recipes with rare components.

v4.0  - Conversion of code to use Objects.
      - Optmised code which will make the craft script run a lot faster.
      - It will check Primary Components and Build components for vendor bought items or harvested components regardless of process.
        This will fix any problems with Provisioner recipes in the past.
      - Fixed several bugs.

v3.4  - Few minor bug fixes.

v3.3  - Several fixes
      - Added Level Range for the recipe list.
      - Option added to skip moving to stations, and only use your current targetted station to craft. This will help for special station devices in instances.
      - Non-UI syntax: /craft "Recipe Name" <Quantity> <Quality> -p(ristine) -s(kip inventory checking) -i(gnore station check)

v3.2  - Fix for Level 1-19 Spells.

v3.0  - Fix for Kingdom of Sky Expansion and numerous changes.

v2.5  - More functionality added to the UI.
