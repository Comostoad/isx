Revision History
----------------
v6.5 - Fixed all Imbue Recipes.
     - Minor fix to Writs with regards to the quest update trigger.

v6.4 - Few minor bug fixes

v6.3 - Fixed doors in Qeynos Tradeskills

v6.2 - You can now craft a Recipe from your 'Recipe Favourites' on the command line, which will avoid any prompting.
       Example: If you had previously saved a recipe called 'Cobalt full suit' under Advanced, then based on what settings you have currently set,
       you can just type in /craft "Cobalt full suit" and it will automatically craft whatever recipes you had listed under that favourite.
     - Added an optional delay between combines. This can be found under options.
     - You can now set a durability threshold for each quality level using standard or rare recipes. This can also be found under options
       Example: If you set the Durability threshold for Quality 1 to 105%, and Quality 2, to 95%, then the craft bot will only use Durability buffs,
       if the current Durability is less than 105% during the 1st Quality and less than 95% during the 2nd and so on.
       This should allow a lot more flexibility in the crafting process.
     - Added Automatic Crafting of Writs. See the Special Tab.
       You need to select a Tier. This reflects the response you select when obtaining the writ.
       You will need to specify the quantity however, as I did not have time to figure this out. Currently this is set to 10 for each recipe.
       It wont matter if you set a higher quantity as the craft bot will end when its made enough quantity for the recipe writ.
       You can also specify how many writs you want to do.
     - Fixed a few minor bugs that have been posted on the forums.

v6.1 - If a recipe fails to load, it will now open the examine window to retrieve the data from the server.
     - Added filters (Standard, Rare, Imbued and/or Secondary TS) to display in the Recipe List.
       Note: This will also reflect what recipes are loaded as well, when you Add Level Recipes.
     - Fixed several bugs that have been posted on the forums.

v6.0 - The recipe files are no more! The recipe data is now retrieved from the server.
       Note: If the data is not available on your client, it will re-sync and re-process the recipe again.
     - You can now craft Tinkering and Transmuting recipes.
     - Select 'Automatically Transmute Master Crafted Items after Creation' in the Special tab to do just that.
       Note: This is turned off by default everytime you start craft for obvious reasons.
     - Added a checkbox to show only the Secondary Tradeskill Recipes (Tinkering or Transmuting).
     - You can now choose to wait for your power to regenerate a certain amount after each recipe is made if you wish (see options).
     - Fixed the way counters work. After each round, the buffs will be cleared before it uses them again to avoid stacking issues.
     - Tuned buffs in general so its more efficient in crafting.
     - The craft session will remain opened if you dont choose to exit after a crafting session is complete.
     - Lots of general fixes that have been posted on the forums.

v5.3 - More fixes.
     - Added option to camp out after craft session while the bot is crafting.
     - Option to pause the bot when it cant buy all harvest components.

v5.2 - Minor fixes

v5.1 - PC Detection and smarter positioning (more random and not close to other PC's) for any device or NPC.
     - Bot will just move to a station directly if not in a tradeskill instance (so no need for a path file if your crafting at home).

v5.0 - Added buying of harvests, fuels and common components Automatically.
     - Added Automatic creation of Writs.
     - Fixed an issue with missing resouces and bot locking out components in the inventory.
     - Path restructure. All files are now located under ./Scripts/EQ2Craft/...
     - Optimized code to work even faster since subcombines have been removed.
     - Bot will detect if door is open or not, and no longer stop at door to open it, but instead open it while its moving towards it (qeynos).

v4.4 - Fixed issue with not being able to craft Rare combines.
     - Rares or any other unique component used for crafting can be included in the CraftCommon.xml file.
     - Example: <Setting Name="cobalt cluster">cobalt</Setting>
       The 'cobalt cluster' is used to determine whethere is a rare or unique component.
       The 'cobalt' is used for partial matching for loading all recipes in a particular level (so any recipe that has the word cobalt will be excluded).

v4.3 - Fixed craft to work with the current stable IS release.
     - Fixed the locking of components so it should no longer happen.

v4.1 - Craft should now be able to make recipes with rare components.

v4.0 - Conversion of code to use Objects.
     - Optmised code which will make the craft script run a lot faster.
     - It will check Primary Components and Build components for vendor bought items or harvested components regardless of process.
       This will fix any problems with Provisioner recipes in the past.
     - Fixed several bugs.

v3.4 - Few minor bug fixes.

v3.3 - Several fixes
     - Added Level Range for the recipe list.
