Revision History
----------------
20080512 (Amadeus)
  * EQ2Bot now supports custom routines per character.  Basically, you can create an MYNAME.iss file that goes in 
    /Scripts/EQ2Bot/Character Config/ that has custom versions of each of the functions included in the class files.
    These custom functions are called after the main class functions.  See "Amadeus.iss" (in SVN) for an annotated example,
    and this link for a working example: 
    ~ Please note that if you include a custom iss for your character, you MUST include all of the functions listed in 
      the example, even if they're all empty but the one thing you're using (see working example link above.)

20080509 (Amadeus)
  * The "Pet Pull" routine got a revamp.  It should be MUCH improved now.  It will be highly more effective for those that choose
    "Manual Movement" mode and want to hunt from a static location.  However, the improvement affects all movement modes and should
    be a noticeable positive change.
  * Unclicking a Movement Mode checkbox (in the UI) will now properly reset you to "manual movement" mode.
  * NOTE:  If you are getting "There is no entity in this area with an ID of ######" -- it is because you have more than one bot 
           looting.  Either ignore the message (which is fine) or select only one bot to do that actual looting of chests/corpses.
  * There is now an option for looting previously collected shineys.
  * The "AutoPull" area of the UI should update/work MUCH better now.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
;2.7.2b (Amadeus)
; * Major update to "Auto Hunting" mode, especially for those that use a bow or a spell/combat art.  It utilizes line of sight, collision
;   detection, and maintains a temporary nopull list.  It also does things a lot more sanely than before.
;
;2.7.2a (Pygar)
; * Added a check to verify target exists before adding to donotpull collection.  This was just to set peoples mind at ease
; * Removed a range verifaction from CheckPosition causing it not to fire when MA was more than 8 meters from target.  This
;		setting no longer holds much water with RoK ranged mob AI's.  Use the max range on main tab to set how far to set safe
; 	distances to move.
;
;2.7.1m (Amadeus)
; * The bot will again loot chests (that are close by) during/between combat.  It will loot chests further away after combat has completed.
; * "AutoFollow" should no longer attempt to autofollow if the person to whom the bot is trying to follow (or the bot itself) is on a
;   griffon-like transport or if they (or the bot) are currently climbing a wall.
;
;2.7.1l (Amadeus)
; * Added a function to EQ2BotLib.iss called "AmIInvis".  CastSpell() and CastSpellRange() now check this before they
;   will cast any spells outside of combat.
; * Tweaked CheckAbilities().  It should work for all players at all times now if AA abilities are properly listed in
;   spell lists as level 10 for all classes.
;
;2.7.1k (Pygar)
; * Added a knowledgebook toggle to the begining of CheckAbilities.  Several higher level users reporting sporadic AA ability
;		usage due to ability not being loaded.  We may need to actually attempt examine methods on a missing ability, more testing to
;		follow.
;
;2.7.1j (Pygar)
; * Updated InvalidMasteryTargets collection to only add targets if they exist, and to work off KillTarget instead of
;		target in case healer has targeted another mob by time trigger fires.
;
;2.7.2i (Amadeus)
; * All Post_Combat_Routine functions (in all of the class files) should have this as their default case:
;		Default
;			return PostCombatRoutineComplete
;			break
; * The "Stop EQ2Bot" and "Pause EQ2Bot" buttons should now work properly
;
;2.7.2h (Amadeus)
; * Renamed the method "CheckSpells" to "CheckAbilities" and moved it to its own function
; * If you are missing more than 6 abilities that are within 20 levels below your current level, EQ2Bot will assume that it is an error.
;   It will then open your knowledge book, wait a half second, and then try again.  This should fix the issue where eq2bot does not
;   initialize properly when you first start up EverQuest2.  (The console spew during initialization should tell you everything you need to know.)
; * Fixed a bug in EQ2BotLib.iss that was causing the "Invalid operator in calculation (single equal)" error message on startup. (This
;   was probably causing a bug with raid healing by the way.)
; * Various updates/optimizations (ie, the CheckLoot() function should make a lot more sense now)
;
;2.7.2g (Amadeus)
; * EQ2Bot now maintains a "DoNotPullList" collection.  Initially, this list is only populated with actors for which the message
;   'you may not order your pet to attack the selected or implied target' is sent to the client.
; * EQ2Bot now maintains a "InvalidMasteryTargets" collection.  Each class routine file will have to be updated to utilize this
;   feature (see Fury.iss for example)
; * EQ2Bot will no longer loot corpses during battle if you have "Loot Corpses and Chests" unchecked
; * The Detect() method now uses the ${EngageDistance} variable to determine how closely it should check for mobs (which is set based
;   upon character archetype during Init_Character()
;
;2.7.1f (Amadeus)
; * There is now two options on the UI in regards to looting lore items and looting no trade items.
; * If a loot item is a collectible, and you've already collected it AND there is more than just yourself in your group, you will decline.
;
;2.7.1e (Amadeus)
; * Various fixes to Math.Calc (to Math.Calc64) when used in conjunction with Time.Timestamp
;
;2.7.1d (Amadeus)
; * Added a 'Health' case to the CheckCondition function (see Fury.iss (Combat_Init() and Combat_Routines()) for examples)
; * Removed some scripting that was causing crashes in the onLootWindowAppeared atom
; * Added a 'GroupWiped' variable (bool) that is set to TRUE whenever "Revive on Group Wipes" is checked and your entire
;   group wipes.  This variable can be checked in the class file at any point and should be reset to FALSE after any desired
;   action has been taken.  See Fury.iss (Buff_Routine()) for example.
; * Added a 'InitialBuffsDone' scriptwide variable (bool) that is set initially set to FALSE.  This is to allow for specific class
;   files to cast buffs (or any other spells) when the script is first run (ie, to give out rez feathers.)  See Fury.iss (Buff_Routine()) for example.
;
;2.7.1c (Pygar)
; Adjusted for new IsDead member of Actor.  This will fix false positives on death checks due to coagulate and other unconcious health buffs.
;	Adjusted MA_Dead and MT_Dead functions
; Adjusted LostAggro - Now fires with the ID of the mob that is lost, it no longer switched the MT's killtarget to the add.  This should allow
;	for mezing to be more effective, and allow for more control of how to react to aggro loss in the Lost_aggro() function in individual class files.
;
;2.7.1b (Pygar)
; Minor tweaks to AcceptWindow code
;
;2.7.1 (Pygar)
; Updated Lootwindow to fire on isxeq2 events rather than triggers
;	Update LootWindow to process on current window ID, this should allow for processing more than one window at a time now.
;
;2.7.0 (Blazer)
; You can now set Points of Interest for Dungeon Crawl Mode (This will help with moving to designated points that you want your bots to pass through)
; POI's can be re-arranged in priority order (top being first) by clicking and dragging the selection in the listbox.
; POI's can be excluded as well.
; Fixed MoveToMaster
; Added a Main Assist Range. This will ensure your group members dont engage a target unless the Main Assist is within this set range.
;
;2.6.1 (Pygar)
; Using new Loot Events
; New Pull code for Pet / Bow / Spell
; Pull Tweaks
;
;2.6.0 (Blazer)
;Pathing is now done with LavishNav
;
v2.40 -   
    * Re-coded the follow script to use objects.
    * First stage of converting eq2bot to use objects.

v2.31 -
    * Fixed some issues when grouping with 1 or more players and follow (i.e bots will no longer try to follow once in combat).
    * Only the Main Assist will move if there is aggro nearby with AutoHunt.

v2.30 -   
    * Fixed an issue with refreshtimer for CastSpellRange
	* If you go out of range with AutoHunt, it will move closer (randomly) to the home point instead of going directly there.
	* More fixes and tweaks with eq2bot and follow.
	* Improved Defiler, Wizard, Bruiser and Conjuror class scripts as well as fixing some bugs.
	* Pressing F11 will now stop eq2bot no matter what it was currently doing.

v2.25 -   * Added more functionality to AutoHunt. If your fighting or just resting, it will check to see if you get adds, and move away appropriately.
	* Several fixes to the last update.

v2.20 -   * You can now select a Main Tank within a raid for assist.
	* Increased Preaction array to 20. Make sure you change xAction:Set[20] in the class routines for Buff_Routine function.
	* Removed CheckHeals from eq2bot and moved it into the specific class routines. If you need any function called before or 
                after any action like CheckHeals (pre-combat, combat or post-combat) then see Templar.iss for an example.
	* Modified the CastSpellRange Function as follows;
	  The Syntax is - call CastSpellRange <start> <finish> <rangetype> <position> <targettobuff> <notall> <refresh timer>
	  Where <start> and <finish> is the spell range you want to cast.
	  <rangetype> (1=close, 2=max range, 3=bow shooting)
	  <position> (0=anywhere, 1=behind, 2=front, 3=flank)
	  <targettobuff> is the ID of the Actor you want to buff or target for the spell
	  <notall> 1=If it casts a spell in the range, then ignore the remaining spells in the range (example, casting 2 different rezzes, it will only cast the first one thats ready)
	  <refresh timer> Specify a time to refresh that spell (see below for a good example).
	  After you call CastSpellRange, you can use ${Return} to check the TimeUntilReady for spells like mezzes.

	  e.g Lets say you want to keep root on a mob. You will have to add a new function in your class routine (Like for Checkheals) in the Combat_Routine function.

	  function Combat_Routine(int xAction)
	  {
		call CheckRoot
	  	switch ${Action[${xAction}]}
		{
			<rest of code here>
		}
	  }

	  function CheckRoot()
	  {
		; This will keep root on a mob and recast when it has 5 seconds left on the existing root.
		call CastSpellRange 230 0 0 0 ${Target.ID} 0 5

		; Add code to check your not close to mob, and backup for a few seconds if need be.
	  }

v2.10 -   * Fixed AutoHunt. Should be a lot improved with the way it works now.

	  Ensure other bots are using follow mode.

v1.50 -	* File Paths have been completely restructured.
	* Lots of tweaks and fixes.
	* Added AttackNamed variable if you want to attack named mobs (TRUE by default).
	* AutoHunt fixed.
	* Puller will now scan each waypoint for mobs to pull, before he goes out and pulls (scan upto 150 range)
	* If the main assist dies, then it will automatically pick an appropriate 2nd assist based on class and HP.

v1.30 -	* More class routines for the lower levels have been added.
	* More tweaks and tunning to class routines and the main eq2bot.
	* Added a Auto Hunting option. e.g
		run eq2bot -a
	  This is currently and experimental feature which lets the bot automatically pick targets, run to them and kill them.
	  If you want to use this method for soloing, then you can add special case routines to check for ${AutoHunt}.
