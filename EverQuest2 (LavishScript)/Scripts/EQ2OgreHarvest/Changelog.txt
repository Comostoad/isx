Updated precision for harvesting.. Should fix the standing beside a node not doing anything.

Version 1.004 - Updated by Kannkor
Rare total count now updates when you get them, rather than only when switching between windows forcing an update all.
Collecting ! and ? should be fixed.. for real this time.. A side effect for now is you will get closer to all nodes. Feedback this if it is creating a problem. (Including ping-ponging)
! and ? counts were combined and should now work.
