
; Emergency healer script, by Equidis.

; This script scans group members, and if any are below 100% health, it will cast a group heal.
; Not designed to target and heal, it's more of a general group heal..

; Warden and Fury Adep 3, and Master I, II Group heal is known to keep a tank in perfect health, and uses little power.
; It can also keep all group members at perfect health, unless you're overwhelmed by mobs, which any bot could not keep up with.

; I would normally just spam the group heal, but that was eating too much power at lower level,
; so now it will only hit it when someone in the group is low health
