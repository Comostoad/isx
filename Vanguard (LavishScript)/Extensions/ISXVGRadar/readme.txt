This is ISXVGRadar, the UI forISXVG's radar functionality under Vanguard

It is ported from ISXEQ2Radar, originaly by someone, and edited by other
someones.  

We do not yet have texture files for Vanguard, so I've used the EQ2
textures to spruce up the config UI.

These files can be found in Subversion at

 http://www.isxgames.com/isxScripts/EverQuest2%20(LavishScript)/Interface/windowelements.dds
 http://www.isxgames.com/isxScripts/EverQuest2%20(LavishScript)/Interface/commonelements.dds


They should be optional.  They would be placed in your Interfaces directory.


To use this radar skin, place the xml files from this directory in your InnerSpace\Extensions folder,
and then type radar on in the innerspace console within Vanguard.
