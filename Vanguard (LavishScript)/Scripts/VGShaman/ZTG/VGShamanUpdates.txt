Version: 20070430.01
 -- Added Pet ability use
 -- Added melee combat modes: No Melee, Melee but dont move, Melee and move to mob

 -- Changed Follow to always re-check follow targets ID.  Ran into issues using just ID,

 -- Slows/Debuffs will no longer cast if there are 3 or more mobs in your current encounter.
		(Known Issues)
 -- New pet ability code can spam the client window if a ability has been selected to be used
		but not actually used yet. (i.e. pet still pathing to target)
